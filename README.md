# LOTO APP

---

Application written in Python, Flask, SQL, JS, bare HTML and CSS.

This application was written for the S4CA competition in a very short timeframe and thus comes with *no guarantee of support nor stability*.

Use at your own discretion. Unknown bugs and security flaws may exist, as with any other project.

In its current state, at least the passwords are hashed with pbkdf2_sha256 on default settings.

To launch, run db_helper.py once, then run the flask app, after setting the env variable.
